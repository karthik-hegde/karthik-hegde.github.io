I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science adviced by Prof. [Chris Fletcher](http://cwfletcher.net){:target="_blank"}. 

Before joining [CS@Illinois](https://cs.illinois.edu){:target="_blank"} at UIUC, I worked at [ARM](https://www.arm.com){:target="_blank"}. My work at ARM included research on Deep Learning accelerators, SoC design/verification and GPU verification. I received my bachelors from [NIT-K Surathkal](http://www.nitk.ac.in){:target="_blank"} in 2015 from ECE department, where I was advised by Prof. [Sumam David](http://sumam.nitk.ac.in){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests are in developing hardware accelerators for challenging applications. I am a strong proponent of heterogeneous system architectures, where specialized processors do the heavy lifting to provide the necessary speed-up. This, is the path to Exascale Computing!
