I am a first year PhD student in Computer Science adviced by Chris Fletcher. My research interests are in developing hardware accelerators for challenging applications. I am a strong proponent of heterogeneous system architectures, where specialized processors do the heavy lifting to provide the necessary speed-up. This, is the path to Exascale Computing!
