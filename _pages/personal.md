I grew up in a village near [Sirsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirsi,_Karnataka){:target="_blank"}, a town situtated in the middle of [Western Ghats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Ghats){:target="_blank"}. The area is blessed with lush ever-green forests, breathtaking water falls, beautiful hill-tops and has a very rich cultural heritage. 


I have a strong interest in Indian classical music. I am an amateur flautist in Hindustani style of Indian Classical Music and have been practicing under the guidance of Sri Prakash Hegde since 2 years. Here is a [video](https://www.facebook.com/Karthikhegde7/videos/1413755802036304/){:target="_blank"} from my recent performance.
