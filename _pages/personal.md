I grew up in a village near [Sirsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirsi,_Karnataka), a town situtated in the middle of [Western Ghats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Ghats). The area is blessed with lush ever-green forests, breathtaking water falls, beautiful hill-tops and has a very rich cultural heritage.

I have a strong interest in Indian classical music. I am an amateur flautist in Hindustani style of Indian Classical Music and have been practicing under the guidance of Sri Prakash Hegde since 2 years. Here is a [video](https://www.facebook.com/Karthikhegde7/videos/1413755802036304/) from my recent performance.
