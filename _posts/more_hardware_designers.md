We Need More Hardware Designers!
======

If we look back at how computing has evolved over the last 50 years, there is little doubt that a major innovation in the hardware world has always enabled new applications and related software development. However, there is an interesting trend: major breakthroughs in the hardware world are once in a decade occurrences while the software ecosystem is quick to adapt and innovate with the available hardware to reap all its benefits.

While a large part of this is due to the little investment required to develop new software, we can concede that there is a large disparity between the number of hardware designers and the number of software developers normalized to the demand in respective fields. We, the architecture community, need to take swift measures to change this. Especially with new challenges in computer architecture with the demise of Moore's law, we need more hardware designers innovating to bring a radical shift in the way processors are designed today.

Why is there a deficit?
------
Interestingly, it is quite easy to figure out why there is a deficit of hardware designers. Visit any major CS university and ask the students, "Among hardware design and software development, which one do you think is easy?". I am willing to bet that greater than 90% of the crowd will vote for software development. As an architect, it is tempting to establish superiority by claiming the complexity -- the only issue is that there is none. Hardware design is not rocket science, it is as straight-forward as software design. All that is needed is a change in the way we think while writing a piece of code.

Anything that you write in software goes as an instruction and it runs on the hardware once (unless called again). While a piece of hardware that you write is synthesized to something that will exist as long as the chip is in use. This fundamental difference has two implications: there is an inherent parallelism in the way you design hardware, and you are required to be prudent before adding even a single line of code as it converts to a real hardware block.

If you set out to learn a new programming language, there is a ton of resource out there that can easily get you started. However, if you decide to learn a HDL (Hardware Description Language), after ignoring the folks who will call you crazy to be pursuing that, it is hard to find enough high quality teaching material, open source compilers and testing methods. I challenge you to spot a reasonable amount of production quality of Verilog open sourced while compared to the humungous amount of high quality software that is avaialble.

How do we change this?
------
More universities, professors and graduate students need to be proactive in educating the world on hardware design. Online learning platforms like Coursera, edX, Udacity etc need to open up and offer more online courses on hardware design. We need to develop a lot of open-source code that can be reused by people across the globe. We need to fund, appreciate and widen efforts like iVerilog to provide open-source compilers for HDLs. Finally, the start-up ecosystem in hardware world needs a very strong push by reducing the cost-to-market and time-to-market factors. 

What do we gain?
------
In my opinion, increasing the sheer number of hardware designers is the key to drive new innovation. This encourages a lot of resources becoming open source and paves path for new startups. A solid startup environment incubated by large corporations, governments and the universities can go a long way in maintaining or exceeding the growth that we were blessed with Moore's law.

What can I do?
------
I hope to develop a new online course on application specific hardware design, if you are interested, please reach out to me!
